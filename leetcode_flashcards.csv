"1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses (Medium): Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters, remove the minimum number of parentheses so that the resulting string is valid. Return any valid string. A valid parentheses string is defined as:
- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
- It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

**Example 1:**
Input: s = 'lee(t(c)o)de)'
Output: 'lee(t(c)o)de'
Explanation: 'lee(t(co)de)' , 'lee(t(c)ode)' would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**
Input: s = 'a)b(c)d'
Output: 'ab(c)d'

**Example 3:**
Input: s = '))(('
Output: ''
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.","**Brute Force Solution:**
1. Generate all possible subsequences of the input string.
2. For each subsequence, check if it's a valid parentheses string.
3. Keep track of the longest valid subsequence found.
4. Return the longest valid subsequence.

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n * n), where n is the length of the input string. Generating all subsequences takes O(2^n) time, and checking the validity of each subsequence takes O(n) time.

**Optimized Solution:**
1. **First Pass (Left to Right):**
   - Initialize a balance counter.
   - Iterate through the string:
     - If the character is '(', increment the balance.
     - If the character is ')':
       - If balance is greater than 0, decrement the balance.
       - If balance is 0, mark this ')' for removal.
2. **Second Pass (Right to Left):**
   - Initialize a balance counter.
   - Iterate through the string:
     - If the character is ')', increment the balance.
     - If the character is '(':
       - If balance is greater than 0, decrement the balance.
       - If balance is 0, mark this '(' for removal.
3. Construct the result string by excluding the marked characters.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the string twice.

**Key Points to Remember:**
- The two-pass approach ensures that all unmatched parentheses are identified and removed.
- The first pass removes excess ')', and the second pass removes excess '('.
- This method guarantees the minimum number of removals to achieve a valid parentheses string.
- The approach is efficient with a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input strings."

- Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, making it impossible to reach the last index.","**Brute Force Solution:**
1. Start at index 0.
2. Recursively attempt all possible jumps from the current index.
3. If any path leads to the last index, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n) due to the exploration of all possible jump paths.

**Optimized Solution (Greedy Approach):**
1. Initialize `maxReach` to 0, representing the farthest index reachable so far.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If the current index `i` is greater than `maxReach`, return `false` (cannot proceed further).
   - Update `maxReach` to the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]`.
   - If `maxReach` is greater than or equal to the last index, return `true`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.

**Key Points:**
- The greedy approach efficiently tracks the farthest reachable index, allowing for an early exit if the end is reachable.
- If at any point the current index exceeds `maxReach`, it's impossible to reach the last index.
- This method ensures a linear time solution with constant space usage."

2. Track the number of coins used for each combination.
3. Return the minimum number of coins among all valid combinations.

Time Complexity: O(n^m), where n is the number of coin denominations and m is the target amount. This is due to the exponential number of combinations.

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n) due to generating all subsets.

**Optimized Solution:**

1. Sort the intervals based on their end times.
2. Initialize a variable to track the end time of the last added interval.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals:

**Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid, as each cell is visited and cleaned once.

**Key Points to Remember:**

- DFS with backtracking ensures all accessible cells are cleaned without redundancy.
- Maintaining a set of visited positions prevents cycles and unnecessary operations.
- Managing the robot's orientation is crucial for correct movement and backtracking.
- The robot's API limitations require careful handling of movement and direction changes.
- The solution must be robust to any room layout and starting position.

Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5].","Brute Force: Parse the string to extract node values and structure, recursively build the tree. Time Complexity: O(n). Optimized: Use a stack to manage nodes and parse the string iteratively, handling parentheses to determine child nodes. Time Complexity: O(n). Key Points: Utilize a stack to track nodes, parse integers for node values, and manage parentheses to establish tree structure."
"545. Boundary of Binary Tree (Medium): Given the root of a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in anti-clockwise direction starting from the root. The boundary includes the left boundary, all the leaf nodes, and the right boundary in order without duplicate nodes.

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,4,2]
Explanation:
- The left boundary is empty because the root does not have a left child.
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 2 -> 4.
- The leaves from left to right are [3,4].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [] + [3,4] + [2] = [1,3,4,2].

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10]
Output: [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
Explanation:
- The left boundary follows the path starting from the root's left child 2 -> 4.
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 3 -> 6 -> 10.
- The leaves from left to right are [4,7,8,9,10].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [2] + [4,7,8,9,10] + [6,3] = [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].","Brute Force Approach:

1. Perform a level-order traversal to collect all nodes.
2. Identify and extract the left boundary, leaf nodes, and right boundary from the collected nodes.
3. Concatenate these lists to form the boundary.

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) due to the need to traverse the tree and then process the list to extract boundaries.

**Optimized Approach:**

1. **Left Boundary:** Traverse from the root's left child down to the left-most node, adding nodes to the boundary list, excluding leaf nodes.
2. **Leaf Nodes:** Perform an in-order traversal to collect all leaf nodes.
3. **Right Boundary:** Traverse from the root's right child down to the right-most node, adding nodes to a temporary list, excluding leaf nodes. Reverse this list before adding it to the boundary list.
4. **Combine:** Concatenate the root, left boundary, leaf nodes, and reversed right boundary to form the final boundary list.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) as each node is visited once.

**Key Points:**

- Ensure that leaf nodes are not duplicated in the boundary list.
- Handle edge cases where the tree has only a root node or lacks left/right subtrees.
- The right boundary should be added in reverse order to maintain the anti-clockwise direction.

"636. Exclusive Time of Functions (Medium): Given n functions running on a single-threaded CPU and a list of logs representing their start and end times, calculate the exclusive time spent in each function. Each log is formatted as '[function_id]:[start|end]:[timestamp]'. The exclusive time is the total time a function spends executing, excluding time spent in nested function calls.

Example:

Input: n = 2, logs = ['0:start:0', '1:start:2', '1:end:5', '0:end:6']

Output: [3, 4]

Explanation:

- Function 0 starts at time 0 and runs for 2 units until time 1.

- Function 1 starts at time 2, runs for 4 units until time 5.

- Function 0 resumes at time 6 and runs for 1 unit until time 6.

Total exclusive times: Function 0: 2 + 1 = 3, Function 1: 4.","Brute Force Approach:

1. Parse each log to extract function ID, type (start/end), and timestamp.

2. Simulate the execution by iterating through each log and maintaining a record of active functions and their start times.

3. For each 'start' log, note the function's start time.

4. For each 'end' log, calculate the time elapsed since the corresponding 'start' and add it to the function's exclusive time.

5. Adjust the exclusive times of parent functions to exclude the time spent in nested calls.

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Optimized Approach:

1. Initialize an array to store the exclusive times for each function.

2. Use a stack to keep track of the function call hierarchy.

3. Iterate through each log:

   - For a 'start' log:

     - If the stack is not empty, update the exclusive time of the function at the top of the stack by adding the time elapsed since the last timestamp.

     - Push the current function ID onto the stack.

     - Update the previous timestamp to the current timestamp.

   - For an 'end' log:

     - Pop the function ID from the stack.

     - Calculate the time elapsed since the last timestamp, add 1 (to include the current timestamp), and add it to the exclusive time of the function.

     - Update the previous timestamp to the current timestamp plus one.

4. Return the array of exclusive times.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Key Points:

- Utilize a stack to manage function call hierarchy and track active functions.

- Update exclusive times by calculating the difference between consecutive timestamps.

- Ensure to account for the inclusive nature of 'end' timestamps by adding one to the calculated duration.

- Maintain a previous timestamp variable to accurately compute time intervals between logs.

- This approach efficiently handles nested and sequential function calls on a single-threaded CPU."

2. For each element, check if it's greater than both its previous and next elements.
3. If such an element is found, return its index.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Optimized Solution:
1. Initialize two pointers, 'left' at the start and 'right' at the end of the array.
2. While 'left' is less than 'right':
   - Calculate 'mid' as the average of 'left' and 'right'.
   - If 'arr[mid]' is less than 'arr[mid + 1]', move 'left' to 'mid + 1'.
   - Otherwise, move 'right' to 'mid'.
3. When 'left' equals 'right', return 'left' as the peak index.

**Key Points:**
- The array's structure allows for a binary search approach, reducing time complexity.
- By comparing 'arr[mid]' with 'arr[mid + 1]', we determine the direction towards the peak.
- This method efficiently narrows down the search space by half in each iteration.
